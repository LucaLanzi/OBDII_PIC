### By Luca Lanzillotta and Zihong Zheng ###
*Abstract:*
* [*Link to original Cornell Project*](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/s2012/ppv5/index.html)
* Create an OBD II scanner that is compatible with any ISO OBC II standard to read basic vehicle telemetry and diagnostics. The design will utilize a Sparkfun OBD II to UART intpreter board and will utilize half duplex capabilities to send requests from the PIC18F46K22 and receive data to display on an LCD. Additionally the board will include buttons to navigate a menu to send and receive specific requests such as RPM, Oil Pressure, Cylinder Diagnostics, and will have a dedicated mode to display live data on the display. 

### Components: ###
* Microcontroller: 
    * PIC18F46K22 and curiosity board (might not use if we design a PCB)
* OBC II to UART: 
    * Sparkfun OBD-II to UART board
* Display: 
    * Generic Microcontroller compatible LCD
* Buttons: 
    * 4/5 buttons in a d-pad style arrangement to emulate a controller d-pad
* Casing: 
    * 3D printed encasing to hold all the components together
* PCB: 
    * Potential to design and manufacture a little PCB that holds the pic together with its necessary connectors to communicate to the board.
